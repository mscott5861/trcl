# urcl

A playground for developing ideas about component libraries.

## Dependencies

- `node` (developed using v8.10.0)
- `npm` (developed using 3.5.2)

## Usage

Not particularly useable at the moment, as it isn't structured correctly for use as an `npm_module`.

Clone the repo, `cd` to the root level of the project, and run `npm install`.

To start the development server, run `npm run start`, then navigate to `localhost: 3000` (by default) in your browser.
You'll be greeted with whatever is currently being worked on, and can scour the directories to look at components.
